## Component Description:
This UI component is used for displaying KPIs in a dashboard layout. KPIs may be displayed as a tile with one large number or value.

## Objective:
I set up this prototype in order to test and validate my assumption around the value of animated numeric values and also, on animated weather widgets. I worked with constraints that offered fixed sizes to the different widgets inside the component and needed to evaluate the behavior of different label sizes and numeric values. I implemented subtle icon animations to the wheather widget which, based on location, would show the relationship between text forcast and the icon design.

## Outcome:
User testing was very positive, mostly around the enhancement of the weather widget. The animated numeric values proved to be too much due to the density of the labels and data.
