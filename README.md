## Description:
This UI component is composed of several smaller widgets used for displaying KPIs in a dashboard layout. KPIs may be displayed as a tile with a header label, one large number or value and its associated UoM.

## Objective:
I set up this prototype in order to test and validate an assumption around the value of animated numeric values and also, on animated weather widgets. I worked with constraints that offered fixed sizes to the different widgets inside the component. I needed to evaluate the behavior of the different label sizes and numeric values. I implemented subtle icon animations to the wheather widget which, based on location, would show the relationship between text forcast and the icon design.
